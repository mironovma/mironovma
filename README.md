### Some words about me

<p>
    🎯 I'm currently building <a href="https://github.com/chewmountain">sport_project</a>, this app helps to process large amounts of data for the organizers of sports events.
    <br>
    ☕️‍ When I'm not woking, I sometimes do some my pet-project's.
Last: <a href="https://github.com/chewmountain/pomodoro">Pomodoro</a> (todo list with pomodoro technique), <a href="https://github.com/chewmountain">@second_project</a>.
    <br>
    🌱 I'm also learning more technologies like react native and web3.
    <br>
    🍺 Beside programming, I am interested in finance, like stock market and crypto. Also I enjoy to play sports like cycling.
